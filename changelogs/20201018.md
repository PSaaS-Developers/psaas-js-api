# Change Log for September 18, 2020

- Added checkValid methods for post-processing validation
    - Should be used in place of the isValid methods
    - Returns a tree that describes errors found in the object
        - Leafs are errors, branches describe the error location
    - If the tree is empty there were no errors
- Added inline error checking through accessors
    - If `SocketMsg.inlineThrowOnError` is true exceptions will be thrown if a value is invalid
- Added [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) for date/time types
    - Anywhere strings required an ISO8601 format there is now a separate accessor (typically prefixed with an l) for using the equivalent Luxon type
    - The original string values are still supported but deprecated
    - Methods that took strings for times may now also take DateTime objects (check the documentation for support).
- Times of day have been changed to Duration
    - Anywhere strings required ISO8601 duration format there is now a separate accessor (typically prefixed with an d) for using a Duration
    - The original string values are still supported but deprecated
    - Methods that took strings for duractions may now also take Duration objects (check the documentation for support).
