# Change Log for December 27, 2020

- Support Buffer for attachments. If reading the attachment from a file don't specify an encoding in the command to read a Buffer instead of a string (ex. `fs.readFileSync('filename.bin')`). This is more efficient and less prone to errors than using a string. String attachments are still supported mainly for text based attachments that are built in code not read from a file.
