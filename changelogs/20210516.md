# Change Log for May 16, 2021

- Added the ability to set a false origin and false scaling for PSaaS v7.
- Specify the default sector data to use for an input weather grid.
- Added oWD, oVD, and dVD to the FGM options to alter wind data.
- Add discritization as an interpolation method for output grid files. This supports an optional discretization parameter to set the resolution of the interpolation. Some output grids require the discretization interpolation method (see the documentation for the list).
- Added some new grid file export types.
- Change parameter names from file to filename.
- Add targets to the API for affecting how wind is handled.
- Updated the API version to the new version format.
- Allow both a start and end time to be specified for grid file exports. Previously only a single time was available and it was used as both the start and end times.
- Removed the version check for running validation in the example job. semver is not compatible with the new version format.
- Add an example total fuel consumed grid file export to the example job. This export uses discretization and separate start/end times.
